      <h2>GSI TIGERS HÃ…NDBALL</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Handball (also known as team handball, European handball or Olympic handball) is a team sport in which two teams of seven players each (six outcourt players and a goalkeeper) pass a ball using their hands with the aim of throwing it into the goal of the opposing team. A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes, and the team that scores more goals wins.

        <b>Message from the team:</b><br>
        Welcome to GSI Handball! We are a committed student handball club that consists of both men's and women's teams. Our men play in the 4th division, while the ladies play in the 5th division. Regardless of the level of the court, we want to gather the students both on and off the handball hall.  
        <br><br>
        At GSI Handball, it's not just about sport; we are also known for having a good sense of togetherness through organizing parties and other cool activities. We are a humble and close-knit group who welcome those who want to throw a little ball.
        <br><br>
        Everyone is welcome in our club, and we have no requirements for previous experience to join. Whether you are a beginner or have played handball before, we want to bring as many people as possible who share our enthusiasm for the sport. You can join the Facebook group, or just show up for training to experience both sporting development and new friendships!
